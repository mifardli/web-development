        <img src="https://iili.io/iX1nol.jpg" alt="rick-and-morty" class="content-images">
        <p>Rick and Morty is the Emmy award-winning half-hour animated hit comedy series on Adult Swim that follows a sociopathic genius scientist who drags his inherently timid grandson on insanely dangerous adventures across the universe. Rick Sanchez is living with his daughter Beth’s family and constantly bringing her, his son-in-law Jerry, granddaughter Summer, and grandson Morty into intergalactic escapades. 
                Rick and Morty stars Justin Roiland (Adventure Time), Sarah Chalke (Scrubs), Chris Parnell (Saturday Night Live), and Spencer Grammer (Greek). The series is created by Dan Harmon (Community) and Roiland, who also serve as executive producers.

<h2> Rick and Morty &ndash; Season 1 Review</h2>
<p>Note: Some spoilers follow for the season.</p>
<img src="https://iili.io/iX1qNf.jpg" class="content-images" alt="r&m sleep" >
<p>
Oh, bless you Rick and Morty. So funny. So foul. And thank the interdimensional sex-bots of Gazorpazorp that this great series, from Justin Roiland (who voices both Rick and Morty) and Community's Dan Harmon, managed to find itself a nice-sized audience on Monday nights and has been granted a Season 2.

When the show first started back in December, it came off as a fun, twisted play on Doc Brown and Marty McFly's relationship from Back to the Future. And for a few episodes after the pilot, it was clear that spoofing famous sci-fi movies (Jurassic Park, Fantastic Voyage, Inception, etc) would be part of the show's DNA. Not the absolute height of creativity, but Rick and Morty still managed to do very funny, original things while riffing on cinema classics.
</p>

<img src="https://iili.io/iX1MUF.jpg" class="content-images" alt="cronenberged-universe" >
<p>Then we were hit with the trio of "Meeseeks and Destroy," "Rick Potion #9" (where Rick and Morty destroy and mutate all of Earth, forcing them to find a new reality), and "Raising Gazorpazorp" (where Morty impregnates a f***-bot) and it was clear that this show could take us to new, deranged levels of hilarity and uncomfortable weirdness. Like the best, mind-bending episodes of Futurama, but with more of a focus on the disturbing and perverse.
Then came "Rixty Minutes," the episode which, in a somewhat hipster-y publicity move, got released early via a series of 15 second clips on Instagram. Because Rick and Morty fans, apparently, were of the ilk that would be "up to the challenge." Whatever. Stunts are stunts. And it got Rick and Morty in the news that weekend. But I'd more readily think that Rick and Morty fans wouldn't dare sacrifice the actual comedy of the show to watch it on a wonky medium. I checked out a few clips and - yup - it killed the laughs.
</p>
<p> The actual episode however, when viewed normally, shined a spotlight on the fact that Rick and Morty could also take an extremely goofy time-out from its usual apocalyptic themes while the family sat and watched TV shows (thanks to one of Rick's devices) from every conceivable reality. And many an "obviously improvised in the recording studio" show was screened. Including a series from a world where hamsters live in people's butts and a version of Who's The Boss? from a world where all nouns start with "Shmluh" ("Shmlangela!" Shmlonathan!") Oh, and extra points awarded to Rick and Morty's casual conversation about the intertwining voice-over careers of Bill Murray and Lorenzo Music.</p>
<img src="https://iili.io/iX13Sn.jpg" class="content-images" alt="interdimensional-cable" >
<p>I'll stick with "Rixty Minutes" a bit longer here in order to mention Morty's parents, Jerry and Beth (Chris Parnell and Sarah Chalke). It would be an easy move for a show to use the surrounding family unit as peripheral players, only bringing them in when a scolding or a "WTF?" reaction was in order. But Rick and Morty utilized all the family members wonderfully - especially weak-willed, delusional Jerry and his nutso narcissism. And most episodes, if things didn't end with the destruction of the universe, they closed out with Jerry and Beth either on the verge of divorce, wallowing in the acceptance of their own depression, or a discovering newfound lust for one another (usually brought about by the destruction of the universe).

The show also dabbled in pools of "meta" now and again. Like how Rick occasionally spoke to the audience and the conscious creation of his catch phrase ("Wubba Lubba Dub Dub!"). And even though it certainly felt like the reset button had been pushed at the top of most episodes, we found out in some of the later chapters that huge plot points actually did carry over. And it's here that we find the sort of humor and storytelling that we love on NBC's Community. In the season finale - "Ricksy Business" - we learned that all the chaos and death that happened in "Rick Potion #9" really happened. And that, indeed, Morty's corpse (from this newly hijacked reality) was still buried in the backyard. And that Rick's "Wubba Lubba" mantra was actual a signal that he was morbidly depressed and lonely. Amazing.
</p>
<img src="https://iili.io/iX1Bt4.jpg" class="content-images" alt="cry rick" >
<p>As touching moments go, Rick and Morty used them sparingly. Bringing them out a bit more blatantly in the final two episodes of the season, where Rick bonded with Morty in "Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind" (despite having used him for years as a sort of "stupid brain waive" cloaking device), and then with both of his grandkids in "Ricksy Business" (teen Summer being the other, voiced by Spencer Grammar). Summer and Rick also got to have their own adventures together in "Raising Gazorpazorp" and "Something Ricked This Way Comes."
</p>
<h3>Verdict</h3>
<p>Here's the part where I try to get you guys to watch this show if you haven't already. Blah blah blibbedy. It's great. It's smart. It'll make you laugh out loud. And it'll, occasionally, totally f*** with your head. It's been a while since an animated series truly entertained like this one has - not sacrificing humor for strangeness, but integrating them together perfectly. </p>

<h2> Rick and Morty &ndash; Season 2 </h2>
<p>Warning: Full spoilers for Rick and Morty: Season 2 below.</p>
<img src="https://iili.io/iX1K9s.jpg" class="content-images" alt="Rick and Morty Season 2" >

<p>
When a show is as clever and inventive as Rick and Morty, its only real competition is itself. The show quickly honed its voice in its first season, setting a pretty high bar for the second season to meet this year. And while a few episodes were guilty of rehashing old concepts, as a total package this season did manage to outdo the first.
One of the more interesting wrinkles with this season was the increased focus on continuity between episodes. While each new installment is still largely standalone, the characters have become more prone to referencing past adventures. The show even built up a supporting cast of sorts, particularly when it came to the recurring appearances of Birdperson and Tammy. The show never got too hung up on continuity. Rather, creators Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon seemed to know just how hard to lean on it as a storytelling device so that some developments (particularly in the finale) carried more weight.

This emphasis on continuity was especially evident in the premiere episode, "Total Rickall," which served as a direct continuation of the Season 1 finale "Ricksy Business." Rick's decision to abuse of time travel to clean up the mess from his house party wound up splitting the timestream into four pieces, each of which unfolded simultaneously on screen. It was a clever concept that was executed with plenty of intelligence and humor. And that pretty much set the tone for the entire season. Many episodes hinged on high-concept storytelling mixed with plenty of hilarity and a dash of poignant character moments. Whether it was Rick hanging out with his ex-girlfriend (a collective consciousness occupying an entire planet's worth of people) in "Auto-Erotic Assimilation" or the incredibly bizarre locked room mystery that was "Total Rickall," there was rarely a dull moment the entire season.This season built pretty significantly on the previous season's revelations about Rick being a profoundly unhappy man. Rick had some real emotional low points over the course of these episodes, including showing a bout of suicidal behavior in "Auto-Erotic Assimilation" and retreating into a teenager's body in "Big Trouble in Little Sanchez." But our drunken hero also showed signs of positive growth this year, showing genuine love and affection for his family from time to time and even sacrificing his freedom to save them in the finale.

One area this season improved was in allowing all the members of the Smith family to shine. Morty himself became a slightly more assertive character, showing that he is growing and evolving thanks to his misadventures with Grandpa Rick. His evolution was key in "Look Who's Purging Now," where all his pent-up rage and sexual frustration exploded onto the screen in a violent orgy of destruction. In his own way, Morty is as emotionally disturbed as his grandfather, which makes those rare moments when Rick protect's Morty's innocence that much more endearing.
</p>
<img src="https://iili.io/iX12cX.jpg" class="content-images" alt="Rick's Family" >
<p>
Meanwhile, Summer essentially became the unofficial third member of their group in the aftermath of "Total Rickall," which was a nice change from her being the show's stereotypical surly teenage girl. Even Beth and Jerry were put to better use. While some episodes still played them as the straight-laced, boring counterpoints to Rick, Morty and Summer, others allowed them to join in on the craziness. "Big Trouble in Little Sanchez" was great about taking their familiar marriage woes and using them as a springboard for something bigger and crazier.

There were some weeks where it seemed Rick and Morty was its own worst enemy. In a series that prides itself on high-concept storytelling, any case where the show is slightly less innovative or where it repeats old storylines is bound to stick out. "Get Schwifty" was one example of this problem. That episode hinged on an "intergalactic American Idol" concept that never quite gelled or lived up to the show's usual standard.

There was also "Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate," the one case where the increased emphasis on continuity might have done the show a disservice. This episode was a direct sequel to Season 1's classic "Rixty Minutes," repeating the concept of Rick modifying a TV set to pick up broadcasts from across the multiverse. No matter how many times the characters acknowledged the fact that they were rehashing an old storyline, it didn't help that episode feel as fresh or funny as the original.

But really, if episodes like "Get Schwifty" and "Interdimensional Cable 2" are the worst Rick and Morty has to offer, that speaks a lot for the show's overall quality. It's rare to see an animated sitcom of such wit and intelligence, and Roiland and Harmon can be forgiven if not every installment is a home run.
</p>
<h3>Verdict</h3>
<p>For a show that started life as an adults-only Back to the Future parody, Rick and Morty has sure developed into something special. The second season continued the formula of merging high-concept sci-fi storytelling with biting humor and a dash of emotionally complex character development for good measure. Occasionally this season was guilty of recycling elements from the first, but as a complete package it managed to outdo its predecessor. The bar is now set even higher for Season 3.

<h2>Rick and Morty - Season 3</h2>

<hr>
<img src="https://iili.io/iX1oV2.jpg" class="content-images" alt="Pickle Rick" >
<p>The first episode of Rick and Morty's third season ends with Rick breaking the fourth wall (as he's often wont to do) and telling his grandson that they're in store for the darkest, craziest season of their adventures yet. That scene really set the stage for what was to come. Season 3 lived up to its promising by even more dark and unpredictable than the previous two. It might be a stretch to call Season 3 the show's best, but in many ways it's the most consistent and ambitious so far.
That sense of unpredictability was in full effect right off the bat, as Adult Swim wound up airing the premiere, "The Rickshank Redemption," in a repeating block on April Fool's Day with no advance warning. Hey, at least that holiday finally became good for something. And given how long the wait between Seasons 2 and 3 was, it was a nice way to reward fans for their patience.
</p>
<img src="https://iili.io/iX1YDx.jpg" class="content-images" alt="Rick's Memory" >

<p>
As mentioned, "The Rickshank Redemption" very much set the tone for the season as a whole. The series was coming off one of best and most emotionally charged episodes in "The Wedding Squanchers." That episode ended on a hugely depressing note, with Rick making the ultimate sacrifice for his family, turning himself into the Federation to spare the rest of the Smith clan from a lifetime of exile on an undersized, empty world. "The Rickshank Redemption" managed to be depressing in a completely different way. Far from establishing that Rick had finally learned to put the needs of his family over his own selfish desires, the premiere saw Rick become even more unhinged and double-down on his arrogant, self-destructive behavior.
Thus, the stage was set for a very different status quo in Season 3. With Jerry mostly out of the picture and Beth ever more eager to please her perpetually absentee father, Rick's id lost whatever fragile safeguards were keeping it in check. What we saw over the course of the next nine episodes was Rick's dark side coming to the forefront. Literally, in the case of "Rest and Ricklaxation." From transforming himself into a talking pickle to waging all-out war on the President of the United States, Rick was never shy about seizing on whatever crazy scheme came to mind.

Rick's wacky behavior was the source of a steady stream of wacky, high-concept sci-fi storytelling. This series is nothing if not extremely clever, but there's always a fear that creators Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon will run out of ways to top themselves and keep pushing the envelope. Maybe the tank will run out of gas someday, but clearly not yet. For the most part, Season 3 was very good about avoiding episodes that rely too heavily on parodying other franchises ("Rickmancing the Stone" being the one major exception) or repeating plots from previous seasons. Thankfully, Roiland and Harmon avoided doing "Interdimensional Cable III," instead opting for the vignette-driven "The Ricklantis Mixup" and the faux-clip show "Morty's Mind Blowers." Nothing could top "Pickle Rick" for sheer hilarity and novelty factor, however.
</p>
<img src="https://iili.io/iX1coQ.jpg" class="content-images" alt="Vindicators" >
<p>
Apart from the high-concept storytelling, Season 3 really excelled when it came to character development. While Rick and Morty has never been an especially continuity-driven sitcom, there's always a clearer sense of progression from the start of a season to the finale. That was especially true this year, with every main character beginning the season in a profoundly different place. Rick was more dominant and self-serving than ever, Beth was just beginning to discover her independence again, while Jerry had to grapple with the loss of his family and whatever shred of self-respect he might have had. And with the adults trapped in their own downward spirals, it fell on Morty and Summer to be the grown-ups in the family.

Morty in particular showed a tangible growth this season. No longer the nervous, constantly agitated sidekick to Rick, Morty began to assert himself and become the voice of reason in the face of his grandfather's over-the-top behavior. Even Roiland's Morty performance seemed a little different this year - reflecting a teenager making his way through puberty and slowly beginning to come to terms with himself. No episode did more to highlight and explore the Rick/Morty dynamic than "The Ricklantis Mixup," which downplayed the main duo in favor of their alternate universe counterparts at the Citadel. That episode offered a lot of fun insight into how the Rick/Morty partnership turned out in other universes, as well as set the stage for what should be an interesting conflict in Season 4.

It's easy to see why some fans might be underwhelmed with the way Season 3 ended. "The Rickchurian Mortydate" didn't reach the dramatic or emotional heights of "The Wedding Squanchers." It was a fairly low-key wrap-up to the season. Still, it managed to bring closure to a season marked by wacky concepts and dark character drama. The finale saw several characters make key decisions about the course of their lives. And it forced Rick to finally account for and face consequences for his actions over the previous nine episodes. There's a certain misguided subsection of the Rick and Morty fanbase who view Rick as a role model and not a profoundly selfish man who usually becomes the architect of his own misfortunes. "The Rickchurian Mortydate" served as a necessary reminder than even Rick Sanchez can (and must) be defeated now and then.
</p>
<img src="https://iili.io/iX10iB.jpg" class="content-images" alt="Rick and Jerry" >
<p> 
Season 3 was a wild ride from start top finish. Unfortunately, it wasn't without a handful of flaws. The biggest being the relative lack of Jerry this year. Jerry is such a wonderfully entertaining and pathetic character that the series misses out whenever he stays out of the picture for too long. Less glaring but still annoying was the complete absence of Birdperson following his brief cameo in the premiere. There were also a couple episodes that didn't quite deliver on their potential. Like I mentioned before, "Rickmancing the Stone" never quite rose above its influences, which made it feel more on par with early Season 1 Rick and Morty. And while "Morty's Mind Blowers" was a welcome shift away from the "Interdimensional Cable" formula, it didn't quite connect in the way "Rixty Minutes" did.

Still, despite these flaws, Season 3 is easily the most consistently good year of Rick and Morty yet. If it didn't quite reach the heights of Season 2's best episodes like "The Wedding Squanchers" and "Total Rickall" (an episode whose genius I'll admit I didn't fully appreciate at the time), its mistakes were few and far between. As frustrating as the wait between seasons can be, as long as Roiland and Harmon keep delivering on this level, they can take all the time they need.
</p>
<h3>Verdict</h3>

<p>Rick and Morty's third season didn't quite reach the heights of Season 2, but it is the series' most consistently entertaining and ambitious season yet. This season pushed the characters in ever-darker and more bizarre directions, further refining that balance between high-concept sci-fi adventure and bleak character drama. The series remains as fresh and exciting now as it was in the beginning.

<h2> Rick and Morty &ndash; Season 4 Review </h2>
<p>
Note: this is a spoiler-free review for Rick and Morty Season 4. 
</p>
<img src="https://iili.io/iX1xPS.jpg" class="content-images" alt="Morty's climbing" >
<p>
    Rick and Morty is a series notorious for keeping its fans waiting. Season 4 premiered over two years after Season 3 wrapped up its run, and fans had to deal with another six-month gap in between the first and second halves. But if we've learned anything over the years, it's that the quality of the series tends to make those long gaps worth suffering through in the end. Season 4 is no exception. If hardly the most consistent Rick and Morty season to date, Season 4 often showcases the series at its very best.
Every new season starts off with a mission statement of sorts, usually delivered by Rick himself in the form of a drunken, fourth wall-shattering monologue. Season 4 is a little different in that regard. The series picks up in the aftermath of Rick's resounding defeat in the Season 3 finale. Having been forced to abandon his feud with the president and failed to prevent Jerry from returning home, Rick is faced with a major shift in the balance of power and a family generally less willing to tolerate his toxic behavior. There's not really a strong narrative thread tying Season 4 together, but there is that greater emphasis on Rick as the self-defeating malcontent who loses many of the fights he picks. At the same time, several episodes illustrate how characters like Morty and Beth are the architects of their own misery rather than innocent victims of Grandpa Rick's ego.
</p>
<img src="https://iili.io/iX1IK7.jpg" class="content-images" alt="Mr. Meeseks" >
<p> Those hoping for a more story-driven season (especially in light of some of the big developments from Season 3) may feel a bit let down by the relative lack of continuity in Season 4. Ultimately, though, that doesn't really matter. We have dozens of new episodes to look forward to in the years to come. Season 4's only real missed opportunity on the storytelling front is its lack of focus on Beth and Jerry. The season does begin to make up for lost time on that front near the end, but it still seems as though more could have been done to explore Beth and Jerry's crudely repaired relationship and the growing rivalry between Rick and his perpetually inept son-in-law.
Instead, Season 4 feels like an intentional return to basics in many ways. The Season 4 premiere helps re-center the series around the concept of a mad scientist and his grandson getting into zany sci-fi adventures. At the same time, never does it feel like Rick and Morty is resting on its laurels or failing to innovate. The premiere is one of many episodes that veers into unexpected territory, even finding ways of exploring Morty on his own terms rather than as Rick's befuddled sidekick. One of Rick and Morty's finest qualities is the way it still functions as a great, high-concept science fiction series if all the jokes are removed, and Season 4 continues that trend.

Occasionally the show tries a little too hard to keep outdoing itself and add new layers to already complex premises. The midseason premiere "Never Ricking Morty" is one example of an episode that doesn't know how to quit while it's ahead. But plenty of other Season 4 installments like the heist movie spoof "One Crew Over the Crewcoo's Morty" and the Jerry-heavy "Childrick of Mort" show just how far the series can take a clever story idea. And perhaps no episode better speaks to Season 4's ability to break the mold than "The Vat of Acid Episode." After multiple attempts to recreate the novelty of Season 1's "Rixty Minutes," the series finally manages to put a fresh spin on the anthology format again.
</p>
<img src="https://iili.io/iX1Gl1.jpg" class="content-images" alt="Rick and Morty - Season 4" >
<p>
The worst that can be said for Season 4 is that the quality never remains very consistent. Season 4 tends to seesaw between great and mediocre. "Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty" is easily the season's biggest misfire - the rare Rick and Morty episode that settles for being bizarre and irreverent rather than actively funny. "Promortyus" is another weak link in the chain. It starts out as a hilarious parody of the Alien movies with an unexpected twist, but that episode peaks early and never really manages to build from that point.

There are times when Season 4 takes a style over substance approach, but that's not always a bad thing. The animation quality has improved to the point where sometimes it's enough to simply revel in the epic carnage and the intricately crafted battle sequences. The revamped Season 4 intro sequence illustrates just how much the show's visual fidelity has improved in recent years, especially when new scenes are juxtaposed with the handful of holdovers from Season 1. The spectacle really benefits episodes like "The Old Man and the Seat." While that episode is fairly unremarkable in terms of plot, the gorgeous animation and the copious amount of celebrity guest stars help elevate the fairly pedestrian material.

Inconsistent or not, Season 4 ends with what is easily the series' strongest finale episode yet. "Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri" captures so much of what makes the series great - the impressive animation, the hilariously outlandish sci-fi concepts, Rick's deep-seated self-loathing, Jerry - and blends it all together in an episode that manages to pay off on some long-standing loose ends and add far more depth to Rick and Beth's relationship. That episode hints at some major status quo changes to come in Season 5, changes that can't be ignored as easily as those introduced at the end of Season 3. No doubt we're in for another long wait, but at least Season 4 proves Rick and Morty is in no danger of overstaying its welcome.
</p>
<img src="https://iili.io/iX1EKP.jpg" class="content-images" alt="Rick and Morty - Season 4" >
<h3>Verdict</h3>
<p>Rick and Morty Season 4 may not be the most consistent in overall quality, but it does boast several of the series' best episodes. Season 4 shows a repeated willingness to think outside the box even as it takes a fairly "back to basics" approach to storytelling. If some episodes wind up feeling under or overdeveloped as a result, that doesn't take away from the hilarity on tap in gems like "Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat" or the clever anthology approach of "The Vat of Acid Episode." Season 4 also ends in top form thanks to "Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri," a finale that teases even better things to come in Season 5.

<h2>Rick and Morty &ndash; Season 5 Review</h2>
<p>Warning: Major spoilers for the Season 5 finale of Rick and Morty, "Rickmurai Jack"</p>
<img src="https://iili.io/iX1uSe.jpg" class="content-images" alt="Rick's Spaceship" >
<p>
After barreling through a season's worth of "classic" Rick and Morty adventures with some juicy plot revelations sprinkled throughout, it should have been obvious that this crop of episodes would end with a bang. "Rickmurai Jack,” Season 5's coup de grace, begins as a continuation of the previous episode, "Forgetting Sarick Mortshall," and jets straight into expository territory with reckless abandon. 

But first, some context. The previous episode found Rick swapping two crows for Morty as his companions, the implication being that anyone or anything -- chosen at random via Rick's handcrafted wheel -- could replace his grandson. What begins as an obvious bit from Rick grew into an all-encompassing obsession with the ways of a crow-like alien race, its technology, and its enemies.
</p>
<img src="https://iili.io/iX1Tl9.jpg" class="content-images" alt="Rick and Morty in the Citadel" >

<p>
    While Morty grapples with his own mistakes after spilling portal gun juice on his hand, forcing him to meet with ne-'er-do-well Nick, Rick is gallivanting off on adventures with his crows. This ultimately culminates in a heartfelt yet bizarrely hasty goodbye from Rick as he packs up his belongings from the garage and takes to the skies, telling Morty their relationship is abusive and, ultimately, untenable.

It's all done so swiftly, with such unfamiliar finality for the series, that it seems like just another ruse. Rick must be baiting Morty, he can't truly be leaving -- but leave he does, and it all spills over into the finale. The crow subplot worryingly usurps the first few minutes of the episode, until a mishap with Morty and an aging serum find Rick literally torching his ties to the crow race and going on a quest to restore Morty's youth.
</p>
<img src="https://iili.io/iX15Ab.jpg" class="content-images" alt="The Citadel" >
<p> 
That takes us, perhaps unexpectedly, to the Citadel, where none other than Evil Morty is waiting. From the moment "our" Rick and Morty meet with the eerily somber and in control version of everyone's favorite grandson, the tone shifts from flippant and silly to a much more serious one. Big things are about to go down -- like Evil Morty stealing the contents of Rick's brain to complete the construction of a device that will catapult him away from the abusive machinations Rick has set in motion: the Finite Curve Barrier. 

Wait, what? Yes, this episode's major reveal is one that fans may have seen coming a long time ago, but one that the series didn't seem too keen on showcasing. Perhaps that’s why, when Morty is given the opportunity to look through Rick’s brain for a chance at some important answers, we’re given a peek at his “crybaby backstory” through a sequence of nearly still, silent shots instead of a segment that lets us focus on or process what’s going on. Rick’s revenge tour to kill the one version of himself who took his family, Diane and Beth, away from him, is unsuccessful, and as such he helps build the Citadel before settling down with an alternate Beth and her family.
</p>
<img src="https://iili.io/iX1RHu.jpg" class="content-images" alt="Morty" >
<p> 
And the Citadel, which seemed more like an innocent type of “housing” for the Ricks and Mortys of the world? A breeding ground for Mortys that have been engineered throughout space and time, to be perfect. Bred from various versions of Beth and Jerry over countless dimensions -- disturbing implications, to say the least, about what Rick is capable of and what he’s willing to do to find some semblance of normalcy or happiness. It’s all incredibly bleak, and somewhat shocking, but incredibly good TV while it lasts. 

But before theres any time to let that, or its ramifications, sink in, Rick and Morty must figure out a way to escape the crumbling Citadel while Evil Morty’s plan is set in motion. Portals have been hacked to kill those that enter them. Ricks and Mortys are dying left and right -- and at the end of it all, Evil Morty seemingly gets what he’s been searching for this entire time: a universe where Rick Sanchez isn’t the smartest man in the universe. But to what end? It will be quite some time before we see any answers to these questions, if we ever do. 

Its intriguing stuff through and through, as this episode was a veritable treasure trove of continuity blasts for those watching for more than just the irreverent humor. There's so much going on that it's difficult to believe all of these developments were somehow squeezed down into a half-hour episode -- and one wonders why it wasn't instead expanded, sans crows, into an hour-long season ender. What's here is a chaotic, sometimes frustrating sprint through what feels like pages and pages of lore condensed into a couple lines of text.

<h3>The Verdict</h3>
</p>Rick and Morty Season 4 may not be the most consistent in overall quality, but it does boast several of the series' best episodes. Season 4 shows a repeated willingness to think outside the box even as it takes a fairly "back to basics" approach to storytelling. If some episodes wind up feeling under or overdeveloped as a result, that doesn't take away from the hilarity on tap in gems like "Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat" or the clever anthology approach of "The Vat of Acid Episode." Season 4 also ends in top form thanks to "Star Mort Rickturn of the Jerri," a finale that teases even better things to come in Season 5.
